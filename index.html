            <h2>About Me </h2>
            <p>My name is Callie Gardunio, but I use the username 'TechJunkie' or 'TechJunkie12' almost everywhere. I am finishing up the last year of my Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity, and have begun to build an online portfolio to display my knowledge and skills in this field. I have formally studied computer information systems for one year, and Cybersecurity for 2.5 years. My knowledge of computers dates all the way back to around the year 2000 when I spent most of my time on Macintosh desktop computers at my elementary school. At home, I played around with Windows 98, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and more recently, Windows 11. I have had a fair amount of experience on MacOS, and a limited amount of experience on Linux (mainly Ubuntu and Kali). I have been troubleshooting various printers, scanners, copiers, peripherals, and internet issues since about 2002, and have been the go-to person to fix all kinds of network, hardware, and software issues for family and friends since I was a young child. I've spent time as an automotive technician, marine electrician, and even a security guard, but now I want to make a more permanent move into cybersecurity. Hopefully, you'll get to watch my portfolio grow, as well as my knowledge and experience! Feel free to contact me with any questions. Thank you for visiting! </p>
