            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This project is a simple password manager with a GUI interface. It saves passwords that you type in, encrypts them, and displays the decrypted passwords when you tell it to</p>

            <h2>Tools Used</h2>
            <p>This was written in PyCharm and used PyQt5 and QtWidgets. QApplication, QWidget, QVBoxLayout, QLabel, QLineEdit, QPushButton, and QTextEdit were all imported and used. Cryptography library was also used, and Fernet was imported. </p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>The very first challenge I faced was very basic: what do I import to make this simple project work? I ended up finding some help guides on PyQt5, so I went this route. I am a beginner when it comes to coding, so I pretty much looked for help from start to finish to ensure my formatting, dictation, and order of the code was correct. I also had to run it often to ensure I hadn't messed anything up. I am starting from square one here, so everything I do in Python is a challenge to me, but I am learning as I go!</p>
